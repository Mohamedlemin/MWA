Instructions
Your Person Hobby Program is a program that demonstrates a hobby you have. Make sure your main hobby has no more than 3 attributes, and it also has an array of sub-documents. Each sub-document also should not have more than 3 attributes. (Example: Football main collection teams, a team has attributes (country, year, color) sub-document is player (name and age as attributes)).

Rule: Football (soccer) is not accepted as a hobby (sorry, too many students share this hobby).

During this weekend you will create a headless CRUD application based on your PHP.

The requirements are:

1- A database-driven application.

2ESport- Your application has a document and an array of sub-documents (using one collection).

3- Perform CRUD operations on the application's primary documents.

4- Perform CRUD operations on the application's sub-documents.

5- Use the proper URL paths and methods to perform CRUD operations as discussed in class.

6- Your application must have API hardening.

7- For Update prioritize the full-update function, then write the partial update (it is acceptable to have duplicate code for now).

8- Make sure to upload your work to Sakai, if you are using GitHub that is fine, but download the latest copy of your GitHub work and upload that. I will only grade what is uploaded to Sakai.

9- Upload anything you have before 10 pm, if nothing is uploaded to Sakai you will get zero.
